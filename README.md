Configuration files for `~/.config/<app>`

### Current configurations: 
* neovim [~/.config/nvim/*]
* ghostty [~/.config/ghostty/config]
* zed [~/.config/zed/settings.json]
* zshrc [~/.config/zshrc/*]

This repo works on an opt-in basis, so things need to be specifically tracked, which is handled in the `.gitignore` file.

To use `zshrc/base.zshrc` on a new machine, add `source ~/.config/zshrc/base.zshrc` to the first line of `~/.zshrc`
